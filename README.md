# GaiaAnalysis-Python
This project demonstrates my ability to work with Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib) within a Jupyter Notebook to manipulate and display data.  Working with data from the Gaia spacecraft to create a Hertzsprungâ€“Russell Diagram for the globular cluster 47 Tuc.
